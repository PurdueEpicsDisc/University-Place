	<h1>UPR Foundation, Inc.</h1>
	<p>&#09&#09&#09<h2>is the Foundation for University Place Residents.</h2></p>
	<h3>Why do we have a foundation?<br>What are its purposes and goals?</h3>
	<p>UPR Foundation, Inc. was created to enhance the quality of life of current and future residents of University Place by serving as a vehicle for funding activities and facilities, amenities, and services over and above those furnished by University Place and required by the Residency Agreement. It seeks to accomplish this mission by receiving tax-deductible gifts and bequests from University Place residents, residents' estates, family members and other donors, and by disbursing such funds through grants approved by the board of directors.</p>
	<p>The UPR Foundation is governed by a nine member Board of Directors.  For a listing of the current members of the board click <a href="#BOD">here</a>.</p>

	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<h3>How and when did the Foundation get started? Who are the members?</h3>
	<p>The Foundation was organized in August 2005 by a group of the original residents. Thirty-eight early residents became Founding Members by contributing at least $1000 each during the period ending November 30, 2005. Since that time over 100 other University Place residents have become members by making a membership contribution of at least $100.</p>
	<h3>What is the relationship between UPR Foundation, Inc. and University Place?</h3>
	<p>The Foundation is separate and distinct from University Place, Inc. and from Franciscan Sisters of Chicago Service Corporation, which owns and operates University Place. UPR stands for University Place Residents. The Foundation is governed by a board of nine directors who are elected by members of the Foundation and who serve for three-year terms. The terms are staggered so that one-third of the board is elected each year. Up to three directors may be nonresidents of University Place. The board elects the officers of the Foundation. The Foundation maintains close cooperation with the management and residents of University Place. The Executive Director of University Place and the President of the Residents' Council are non-voting ex-officio members of the Foundation board.</p>
	<h3>What is the tax status of the Foundation?</h3>
	<p>The Foundation is qualified as a charitable and educational corporation under Section 501(c ) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code. It is exempt from federal and state income tax, and contributions to the Foundation are deductible from federal and state income and estate and inheritance taxes to the extent permitted by law.</p>
	<h3>The Foundation has members. Why? Who are they and what role do they play?</h3>
	<p>Article I of the UPR Foundation Bylaws states "The Corporation shall have Members." Every Contractual Resident of University Place is eligible to become a member.  Members play an important role because they elect the Board of Directors and thus, indirectly, determine how the Foundation operates and what kinds of projects will be supported.</p>
