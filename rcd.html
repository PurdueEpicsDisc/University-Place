	<h1>Resident Association</h1>
	<p>The organization of Residents of University Place is known as the Association of University Place Residents. The role of the Association is to provide a mechanism and forum for the residents a) to communicate with each other and Management and b) to plan and implement programs and activities and to advise on general operations and management of University Place.</p>
	<p>The representative body of the Association is the Residents’ Council.  The Council consists of ten members:  five elected officers (President, President-Elect, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer); one representative from the residents of garden homes and one representative from each of the three floors of the independent living apartments; and a representative from the Assisted Living area.  The Council meets monthly and, by tradition, its meetings are open to residents and/or University Place management representatives. Council meetings are noted on the activity calendar distributed near the beginning of each month. </p>
	<p>As the representative body of the Association the Council encourages residents to express their ideas, concerns, and recommendations to Council members, written communication being preferred.  A listing of Council members and various committees and interest groups is given below.</p>
